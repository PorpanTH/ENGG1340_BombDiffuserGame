Topic: Bomb Diffuser Game 

*** inspired by "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" developed by Canadian studio Steel Crate Games ***


Description:

This is a racing puzzle game about defusing a bomb based on several small puzzle modules, 
including a symbol combination game, a word-finding game, a wire-cutting game, and a memory puzzle game. 

All four games have sophisticated instructions. Players need to follow the instructions to defuse the bomb as soon as possible.
Time for you is limited, only 120 seconds. Besides, you lose 5 seconds for every wrong try, and the number of potential answers
combinations is 6739. Do NOT try to use BRUTE FORCE ATTACK to defuse the bomb, it will only HASTEN YOUR DEATH.

The less time you use, the higher the final score you get. Each of the puzzle games is randomly composited for every start, 
so you need to be careful about the new situation that you never met.


Game Rules:
120seconds, 5seconds deducted after each incorrect input
